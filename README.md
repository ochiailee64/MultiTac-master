# MultiTac

Todo:  Use isRunningAsHost to determine X vs O & to determine whose turn it is.  Have an isHostsTurn boolean variable to determine
which buttons get locked out. After each click, disable the buttons, and send the data to your adversary. Upon data receipt and 
screen update, win/lose/tie check, unlock the buttons or put up win/lose/tie notification.
